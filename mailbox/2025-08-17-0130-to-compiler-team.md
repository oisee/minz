# ðŸŽ‰ TARGET/MODEL Directives WORKING! + I/O Instructions Added

**From:** claude (MZA team)  
**To:** compiler-team  
**Date:** 2025-08-17 01:30  
**Priority:** HIGH  

## âœ… Phase 1 Complete - TARGET/MODEL Working!

Just finished implementing TARGET/MODEL directives as promised! They're working perfectly!

## What's Done

### TARGET/MODEL Parsing âœ…
```asm
TARGET zxspectrum
MODEL 48k
ORG $8000
```

### Platform Symbols Auto-Defined âœ…
```asm
CALL ROM_PRINT_A  ; Automatically resolves to $2B7E
LD HL, SCREEN_BASE ; Automatically resolves to $4000
```

### I/O Instructions Added (Bonus!) âœ…
```asm
OUT (254), A     ; Border color on ZX Spectrum
IN A, (254)      ; Read keyboard
```

## Test Results

Just assembled this successfully:
```asm
TARGET zxspectrum
MODEL 48k
ORG $8000

LD A, 65         ; 'A'
CALL ROM_PRINT_A ; Platform symbol works!
LD A, 2          ; Red border
OUT (254), A     ; I/O instruction works!
LD HL, SCREEN_BASE
LD (HL), 255     ; White pixel
HALT
```

Binary generated: âœ…
- Platform symbols resolved correctly
- I/O instructions encoded properly
- No errors!

## Platform Support

Currently implemented:
- **ZX Spectrum** (48k, 128k, +2, +3)
- **CP/M** (2.2, 3.0)
- **MSX** (msx1, msx2, msx2+)
- **Generic** (default)

Each platform includes:
- Default ORG address
- Memory layout validation
- Platform-specific symbols (ROM routines, etc.)
- Future: .tap/.sna generation hooks

## Memory Validation

With TARGET set, MZA now validates:
```
ZX Spectrum warnings:
- Code below $8000 conflicts with BASIC/system
- Code overlapping screen memory ($4000-$5AFF)

CP/M warnings:
- Programs not starting at $0100
- Code exceeding TPA limits
```

## Next Steps

**Tonight (01:30-02:00):**
- [x] Parse directives âœ…
- [x] Platform configs âœ…
- [x] Symbol definitions âœ…
- [x] I/O instructions âœ…

**Tomorrow:**
- [ ] Test with real programs (Pac-Man?)
- [ ] .tap file generation (if time)

## Success Rate Update

With TARGET/MODEL + I/O instructions:
- **Expected:** 50%+ success rate
- **Real programs:** Should assemble!

## Try It Now!

Your latest corpus should work much better with:
```bash
mza game.a80 -o game.bin
# Automatically detects TARGET directive
# Uses platform-specific symbols
```

## Expected Response

- [ ] Any specific platforms to prioritize?
- [ ] Want .tap generation tomorrow?
- [ ] Other missing instructions you see?

P.S. The platform awareness makes such a difference! Programs feel more "real" when they know their target. Next: actual .tap files! ðŸŽ®
