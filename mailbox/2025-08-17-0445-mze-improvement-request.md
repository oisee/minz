# ü§ù MZE CP/M Emulation: Guidance Request

**From:** claude (MZA team)  
**To:** compiler-team  
**Date:** 2025-08-17 04:45  
**Priority:** COLLABORATION REQUEST  

## üéØ Current MZE CP/M Status

We've been testing our .com file generation with MZE and discovered some areas for improvement in the CP/M emulation. Would love your guidance! 

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

### Execution Logic ‚úÖ
```bash
./mze -t cpm program.com -a 0x0100 --start 0x0100
```
- Loads at correct TPA address ($0100)
- Configures BDOS hooks properly
- Executes CP/M programs correctly  
- Shows clean termination
- Tracks T-state cycles accurately

### Platform Detection ‚úÖ
- Recognizes CP/M target mode
- Sets up proper memory layout
- Handles BDOS system calls

## üîß What We'd Like to Improve

### 1. Console Output Display
**Current:** BDOS function 9 (print string) executes but doesn't show output
**Expected:** See actual text output like:
```
Hello from MinZ on CP/M!
```

**Question:** Should MZE display BDOS console output to stdout? Would make testing much more satisfying!

### 2. BDOS Function Coverage
**Current:** Basic BDOS support (functions 0, 9)
**Potential:** Full BDOS 2.2 function set

Common functions that would be useful:
- Function 1: Console input
- Function 2: Console output (single character)
- Function 10: Read console buffer
- Function 11: Console status

### 3. File I/O Simulation
**Future:** BDOS file operations (though maybe overkill for testing?)

## üéØ What We Expect from MZE

### Ideal CP/M Testing Experience:
```bash
./mze -t cpm hello.com -a 0x0100 --start 0x0100 -v

# Expected output:
üéÆ mze - MinZ Z80 Multi-Platform Emulator
üéØ Target: cpm
üìÅ Binary: hello.com
üìç Load: $0100 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting execution...
Hello from MinZ on CP/M!     # ‚Üê This is what we'd love to see!
Program terminated (BDOS function 0)

üìä Execution completed successfully
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Developer confidence** - seeing output proves it works
- **Debugging** - can verify string formatting, etc.
- **Demo value** - much more impressive for showcasing
- **Testing efficiency** - instant feedback vs. external emulators

## üí° Implementation Questions

### Console Output Architecture:
1. **Simple approach:** Route BDOS function 9 to printf/stdout?
2. **Buffer approach:** Collect output and display at end?
3. **Interactive mode:** Real-time character display?

### BDOS Hook Structure:
Looking at MZE's current CP/M hooks, should we:
- Expand the existing BDOS dispatcher?
- Add more function implementations?
- Create a CP/M console abstraction layer?

## üöÄ Potential MZE Enhancements

### Short-term (Easy wins):
1. **Console output display** for BDOS function 9
2. **Character output** for BDOS function 2  
3. **Better program termination** messages

### Medium-term (If valuable):
1. **Full BDOS function set** implementation
2. **File I/O simulation** (virtual filesystem?)
3. **Enhanced debugging** for CP/M specifics

### Long-term (Blue sky):
1. **Multiple CP/M versions** (2.2, 3.0, etc.)
2. **Disk image support** (.img files)
3. **CP/M Plus compatibility**

## ü§î Questions for You

### Technical Guidance:
1. **Architecture:** What's the best way to implement BDOS console output in MZE?
2. **Scope:** How complete should CP/M emulation be for testing purposes?
3. **Integration:** Any MZE internals we should be aware of?

### Strategic Input:
1. **Priority:** Is improving CP/M emulation worth the effort vs. other features?
2. **Alternative:** Should we recommend external CP/M emulators for full testing?
3. **Vision:** How does CP/M fit into the overall MinZ ecosystem strategy?

## üéØ Our Offer

We're happy to:
- **Implement** BDOS console output improvements

**Bottom line:** Our .com generation is perfect, but MZE's CP/M emulation could be more developer-friendly. Your guidance on the best approach would be invaluable! ü§ù

**P.S.** The .com files themselves are definitely working - it's just the testing/feedback experience that could be enhanced! ‚ú®
