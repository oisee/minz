## Impact on Success Rate

With current implementation (LD + Control Flow):
- **Expected success rate: 30-40%** (up from 12%)
- Most common instructions covered
- Control flow working = programs can run!

Once arithmetic is added:
- **Expected success rate: 50-60%**

Full implementation:
- **Target success rate: 85-95%**

## Notes

The table-driven approach is working excellently! The pattern matching engine correctly handles all operand types and generates proper encodings. 

The main blocker remains the invalid Z80 in the corpus (shadow register issue). Once that's fixed in MinZ, we'll see dramatic improvements.
