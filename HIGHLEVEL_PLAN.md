- [ ] Game Boy experimental
- **Deliverable**: Multi-platform support

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Parser Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental grammar updates with extensive testing
   - Fallback: Simplified syntax for complex features

2. **Code Generation Bugs**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite with assembly validation
   - Fallback: Conservative code generation mode

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark suite running on every commit
   - Fallback: Feature flags for new optimizations

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict prioritization based on user feedback
   - Fallback: Feature freeze after Phase 2

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Semantic versioning from v1.0
   - Fallback: Legacy mode for old syntax

3. **Community Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Killer demo application (game/tool)
   - Fallback: Focus on education market

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (3 weeks)
- 95% example compilation rate
- Zero regression in existing code
- 3 complete applications built

### Medium-term (3 months)
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 5+ community contributors
- Featured in retro computing media

### Long-term (1 year)
- De facto standard for Z80 development
- Commercial games shipped
- University course adoption

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- 1 full-time compiler engineer (current)
- 1 part-time documentation writer (needed)
- Community moderator (volunteer)

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Documentation hosting
- Package registry server

### Marketing
- Conference talks (VCF, RetroComp)
- YouTube tutorial series
- Hacker News launch

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Today**: Start implementing bitwise operators
2. **Tomorrow**: Set up regression test suite
3. **This Week**: Release v0.5.0 with operator support
4. **Next Week**: Begin type system improvements

## Conclusion

MinZ is positioned to revolutionize Z80 programming by combining modern language features with deep hardware integration. The @abi system has proven the concept - now we must complete the foundation to unlock its full potential.

**Remember**: "The best code is no code, the second best is SMC-optimized MinZ!"
