### SMC Implementation Strategies

#### Z80 (Current Implementation)
```assembly
; Parameter patching
call_target:
    ld a, 0x42      ; Immediate patched at runtime
    call function
```

#### 6502 (Superior SMC)
```assembly
; Simpler encoding, cleaner patching
call_target:
    lda #$42        ; Single byte immediate at call_target+1
    jsr function
```

#### 68000 (Workaround Required)
```assembly
; Use lookup table instead of SMC
parameter_table:
    dc.w $0042, $0043, $0044
call_target:
    move.w parameter_table(a0), d0
    jsr function
```

#### WASM (Compile-time Specialization)
```wat
;; Generate specialized functions at compile time
(func $function_specialized_42 (result i32)
    (i32.const 42)
    (call $function)
)
```
