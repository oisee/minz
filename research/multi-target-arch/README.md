## üéØ Architecture Highlights

### Core Design Principles
1. **Zero Disruption**: Existing Z80 workflows remain unchanged
2. **Clean Abstractions**: Target-specific code isolated behind interfaces
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Unsupported features fallback intelligently
4. **Extensible Framework**: Easy addition of new targets
5. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Key Innovations

#### Feature Compatibility Matrix
```
Feature         Z80   6502  68000  WASM   Handling Strategy
SMC             ‚úÖ    ‚ùå    ‚ùå     ‚ùå     Fallback to regular calls
Shadow Regs     ‚úÖ    ‚ùå    ‚ùå     ‚ùå     Use regular registers  
DJNZ Loops      ‚úÖ    BNE   DBRA   ‚ùå     Target-specific patterns
Lambdas         ‚úÖ    ‚úÖ    ‚úÖ     ‚úÖ     Compile-time transform
```

#### Target Registry System
```go
registry := NewTargetRegistry()
target, err := registry.GetTarget("6502")
optimizer := target.CreateOptimizer(config)
codegen := target.CreateCodeGenerator(config)
```

#### Enhanced CLI Experience
```bash
# Current usage (unchanged)
mz program.minz -o program.a80

# Multi-target usage
mz --target=6502 program.minz -o program.s
mz --target=wasm program.minz -o program.wasm
mz --list-targets
mz --check-compatibility --target=wasm program.minz
```

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Extract target interfaces without breaking existing code
- Create Z80 target implementation from existing codegen
- Add target registry with Z80 as default
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)  
- Add CLI target selection
- Implement feature compatibility checking
- Create configuration system
- Add fallback mechanisms

### Phase 3: Validation (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement 6502 target as proof of concept
- Demonstrate feature mapping and degradation
- Create comprehensive testing framework
- Validate architecture with real-world examples

### Phase 4: Expansion (Weeks 9-12)
- Add WebAssembly and 68000 targets
- Create plugin system for external targets
- Performance optimization and polish
- Documentation and release preparation

## üéØ Target Roadmap

### Phase 1 Targets (Built-in)
- **Z80**: Complete existing functionality (SMC, shadow regs, DJNZ)
- **6502**: Zero page optimization, DEC+BNE loops, platform variants
- **68000**: Rich register set, advanced addressing modes
- **WebAssembly**: Modern deployment, browser integration

### Phase 2 Targets (Community/Plugin)
- **ARM Cortex-M**: Modern embedded systems
- **RISC-V**: Open hardware platforms
- **8051**: Microcontroller applications
- **Custom ASICs**: FPGA soft cores

## üìä Expected Benefits

### For Developers
- **Write once, target many**: Single MinZ codebase for multiple platforms
- **Platform optimization**: Each target gets optimal code generation
- **Modern deployment**: WebAssembly enables browser/cloud deployment
- **Legacy support**: Continue using favorite retro platforms

### For the MinZ Project
- **Wider adoption**: Support for popular retro platforms (C64, Amiga, etc.)
- **Modern relevance**: WebAssembly bridges retro and modern computing
- **Community growth**: Plugin system enables community contributions
- **Technology leadership**: Zero-cost abstractions across all targets

## üîß Technical Achievements

### Zero-Cost Feature Mapping
Features like SMC and DJNZ loops gracefully degrade on targets that don't support them, maintaining performance while preserving functionality.

### Compile-Time Specialization
Lambdas and interfaces use compile-time monomorphization, ensuring zero runtime overhead across all targets.

### Target-Specific Optimization
Each target gets optimizations tailored to its architecture:
- Z80: SMC parameter patching, shadow register usage
- 6502: Zero page allocation, page boundary optimization  
- 68000: Register allocation, addressing mode selection
- WASM: Stack optimization, function table management
