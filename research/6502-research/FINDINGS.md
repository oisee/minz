# 6502 Go-Based Toolchain Research for MinZ Multi-Target Backend

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research into Go-based 6502 assemblers and emulators, we found **mixed viability** for 6502 as a MinZ target. While 6502 supports self-modifying code techniques similar to Z80, the available Go toolchain ecosystem is **significantly less mature** than our existing Z80 infrastructure. Current Go 6502 tools are primarily educational/hobbyist projects rather than production-grade compiler backends.

**Recommendation**: 6502 is technically feasible but **not recommended as first multi-target** due to toolchain immaturity. Consider **eZ80** or **68000** as stronger candidates with better Go ecosystem support.

## Self-Modifying Code (SMC) Analysis

### 6502 SMC Capabilities ✅

The 6502 **fully supports** self-modifying code with several advantages:

#### **Instruction Patching Techniques**:
1. **Operand Modification**: Clean byte boundaries allow easy modification of immediate values
   ```assembly
   modify_target: LDA #$00  ; Operand at modify_target+1 can be changed
   ```

2. **Address Patching**: Modify target addresses in STA/LDA instructions
   ```assembly
   store_patch: STA $2000   ; Address bytes at store_patch+1 and store_patch+2
   ```

3. **Opcode Swapping**: Change instruction types (e.g., BIT to JMP for conditional flow)
   ```assembly
   flow_patch: BIT next_routine  ; Changes to JMP next_routine when needed
   ```

#### **Platform-Specific Usage**:
- **Apple II**: Extensive SMC in graphics routines and memory management
- **Commodore 64**: Common in demos, games, and optimization routines
- **Performance**: Essential for 16-bit indexing and high-performance loops

### 6502 vs Z80 SMC Comparison

| Aspect | 6502 | Z80 | Winner |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| **Instruction Encoding** | Clean 1-byte opcodes | Mix of 1-2 byte opcodes | 6502 |
| **SMC Complexity** | Simple byte patching | More complex due to prefixes | 6502 |
| **Performance Impact** | Lower overhead | Higher overhead | 6502 |
| **Register Pressure** | More benefit from SMC | Less benefit (more registers) | 6502 |

**Assessment**: 6502 SMC is **easier to implement** and **more beneficial** than Z80 SMC due to simpler instruction encoding and greater need for optimization.

## Integration Complexity Assessment

### For MinZ Compiler Backend Integration:

#### **High Integration Complexity** ⚠️

**Challenges**:
1. **Toolchain Immaturity**: Most Go 6502 tools are hobby/educational projects
2. **API Inconsistency**: No standardized interfaces between assembler/emulator projects
3. **Limited Production Use**: Unlike our battle-tested Z80 toolchain
4. **Architecture Differences**: Significant differences from Z80 requiring new optimization strategies

**Required Work**:
- **Assembler Integration**: Would need significant API development work
- **Emulator Integration**: Multiple options but none production-ready
- **Optimization Pipeline**: Complete redesign for 6502 architecture
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Build new test suites for 6502 validation

#### **Comparison to Current Z80 Toolchain**:

| Component | Z80 (Current) | 6502 (Proposed) | Effort |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Assembler** | Production-ready (`minzc/pkg/z80asm/`) | Multiple options, none production-grade | **HIGH** |
| **Emulator** | Cycle-accurate (`minzc/pkg/emulator/z80.go`) | Several options, varying quality | **MEDIUM** |
| **SMC Support** | Mature TRUE SMC implementation | Need to build from scratch | **HIGH** |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive | Scattered, incomplete | **HIGH** |
| **Testing** | 148 examples, full E2E pipeline | Would need complete rebuild | **VERY HIGH** |

- Retro computing experiments  
- Academic research tools

**Missing Production Elements**:
- ❌ Comprehensive test suites
- ❌ Performance benchmarking
- ❌ Production deployment examples
- ❌ Corporate/commercial usage

## Technical Feasibility: Architecture Analysis

### **6502 Architecture Advantages** ✅

1. **Simpler Instruction Set**: Easier code generation than Z80
2. **Better SMC Support**: Cleaner instruction encoding for self-modification
3. **Zero Page Optimization**: Fast access to first 256 bytes (pseudo-registers)
4. **Efficient Addressing Modes**: Good for array/struct access

### **6502 Architecture Challenges** ⚠️

1. **Limited Registers**: Only A, X, Y registers vs Z80's extensive register set
2. **Stack Limitations**: Fixed stack pointer, limited stack operations
3. **No 16-bit Math**: All 16-bit operations require multi-instruction sequences
4. **Memory Layout**: Different memory models than Z80 systems

### **MinZ Feature Mapping**:

| MinZ Feature | Z80 Implementation | 6502 Feasibility | Complexity |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Variables** | Register allocation | Zero page allocation | **MEDIUM** |
| **Functions** | CALL/RET with SMC | JSR/RTS with SMC | **MEDIUM** |

## Performance Expectations

### **6502 vs Z80 Performance Profile**:

Based on architectural analysis:

| Metric | Z80 | 6502 | Expected Difference |
|--------|-----|------|-------------------|
| **Clock Cycles/Instruction** | ~4 average | ~2 average | 6502 2x faster |
| **Memory Access** | Every 4 clocks | Every 2 clocks | 6502 2x faster |
| **Register Operations** | More registers available | Fewer registers | Z80 advantage |
| **SMC Performance** | Complex prefixes | Simple opcodes | 6502 advantage |

**Overall**: 6502 should provide **comparable or better performance** than Z80 for MinZ programs, especially with heavy SMC usage.

## Final Recommendation

### **NOT RECOMMENDED as First Multi-Target** ❌

**Primary Reasons**:

1. **Toolchain Maturity Gap**: 6502 Go ecosystem is 2-3 years behind our Z80 toolchain
2. **Development Risk**: Would require 6-12 months of infrastructure development  
3. **Opportunity Cost**: Other targets (eZ80, 68000) may offer better ROI
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Adding another experimental toolchain increases complexity

### **Alternative Recommendations** ✅

**Better First Multi-Target Candidates**:

1. **eZ80**: Modern Z80 variant, can reuse existing toolchain with extensions
2. **68000**: Mature ecosystem, more registers, better for performance showcase
3. **RISC-V**: Modern architecture, growing Go ecosystem support

### **Future Consideration** 🔮

6502 **remains viable for future implementation** once:
- Core multi-target architecture is established
- Production-quality Go 6502 tools emerge
- Community demand justifies development investment

### **If Proceeding Despite Recommendation**:

**Start with**: `beevik/go6502` as the most production-ready foundation
**Timeline**: Expect 6-12 months for production-quality 6502 backend
**Resources**: Dedicated developer needed for toolchain integration
