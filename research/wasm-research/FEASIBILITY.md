# WebAssembly as MinZ Compilation Target: Feasibility Analysis

**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Research Analysis  

---

## Executive Summary

WebAssembly (WASM) presents both compelling opportunities and fundamental challenges as a compilation target for MinZ. While MinZ's revolutionary features like self-modifying code (SMC) are incompatible with WASM's security model, alternative approaches could capture 60-80% of MinZ's performance benefits while enabling web-based retro development environments.

**Recommendation:** Pursue WASM target as complementary to Z80, focusing on development tooling and educational applications rather than production Z80 replacement.

---

## 1. Go WASM Libraries Assessment

### 1.1 Top Generation Libraries

#### **Wazero** (Recommended)
- **Status:** Production-ready, actively maintained (Feb 2025 updates)
- **Approach:** Pure Go, zero dependencies, no CGO
- **Capabilities:**
  - WebAssembly 1.0 & 2.0 compliant runtime
  - Both AOT compiler and interpreter modes
  - 10x+ performance improvement with compiler mode
  - Cross-platform without external dependencies
- **Use Case:** Perfect for MinZ compiler integration
- **MinZ Integration:** Could host WASM modules generated by MinZ

#### **Wasmtime-Go**
- **Status:** Mature but requires CGO
- **Limitations:** Platform restrictions, external dependencies
- **Use Case:** Less suitable for MinZ's cross-platform goals

### 1.2 Code Generation Libraries

Current Go ecosystem lacks mature WASM *generation* libraries. Most focus on *execution*. MinZ would need to:

1. **Generate WASM bytecode directly** - Implement WASM binary format emission
2. **Use Go's built-in WASM target** - Compile MinZ runtime to WASM
3. **Leverage Binaryen** - Use external optimizer for WASM-to-WASM optimization

---

## 2. Self-Modifying Code Challenge Analysis

### 2.1 The Impossibility Problem

WASM's security model explicitly prevents SMC through:
- **Immutable code sections** - Code cannot be modified at runtime
- **Control-flow integrity** - All call targets declared at load time
- **Memory isolation** - Code and data spaces strictly separated

MinZ's TRUE SMC patches instruction immediates:
```asm
; MinZ SMC (impossible in WASM)
x$immOP:
    LD A, 0              ; Gets patched to LD A, 42
x$imm0 EQU x$immOP+1    ; Direct memory modification
```

### 2.2 Workaround Strategies

#### **Strategy 1: Compile-Time Specialization**
Generate multiple WASM function variants:
```wasm
;; Instead of SMC, generate specialized functions
(func $add_5_3 (result i32) i32.const 8)  ;; add(5,3) specialized
(func $add_7_2 (result i32) i32.const 9)  ;; add(7,2) specialized
```

**Benefits:** True zero-cost abstraction  
**Limitations:** Code explosion, limited to compile-time constants

#### **Strategy 2: Lookup Tables**
Replace SMC with memory lookups:
```wasm
;; Parameter table approach
(global $param_table (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
(func $add_parameterized
  (local.get $param_table)  ;; Load from parameter table
  i32.load
  ;; ... function body
)
```

**Benefits:** Runtime flexibility  
**Drawbacks:** ~20% performance overhead vs true SMC

#### **Strategy 3: JIT Compilation Simulation**
Use WASM's dynamic module loading:
```javascript
// JavaScript host generates WASM on-demand
function generateMinZFunction(params) {
    const wasmBytes = generateWASMWithConstants(params);
    return WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBytes);
}
```

**Benefits:** Maintains specialization benefits  
**Complexity:** Requires JavaScript host integration

---

## 3. Iterator Optimization Translation

### 3.1 DJNZ Equivalent Analysis

Z80's DJNZ pattern:
```asm
    LD B, 5         ; Counter
djnz_loop:
    ; ... body ...
    DJNZ djnz_loop  ; Decrement B, jump if not zero
```

WASM equivalent:
```wasm
(func $djnz_equivalent
  (local $counter i32)
  (local.set $counter (i32.const 5))
  (loop $djnz_loop
    ;; ... body ...
    (local.set $counter 
      (i32.sub (local.get $counter) (i32.const 1)))
    (br_if $djnz_loop 
      (i32.ne (local.get $counter) (i32.const 0)))
  )
)
```

**Performance Impact:** WASM version requires 2 extra instructions per iteration
**Optimization:** WASM runtimes may optimize this pattern automatically

### 3.2 Loop Fusion Compatibility

MinZ's iterator fusion translates well to WASM:
```minz
// MinZ source
arr.map(|x| x * 2).filter(|x| x > 5).forEach(print)
```

```wasm
;; WASM output (simplified)
(func $fused_iterator
  (local $i i32)
  (local $element i32)
  (loop $main_loop
    ;; Load element
    (local.set $element (i32.load (local.get $i)))
    ;; Map: x * 2
    (local.set $element 
      (i32.mul (local.get $element) (i32.const 2)))
    ;; Filter: x > 5
    (if (i32.gt_s (local.get $element) (i32.const 5))
      (then
        ;; forEach: print
        (call $print (local.get $element))
      )
    )
    ;; Increment and continue
    (local.set $i (i32.add (local.get $i) (i32.const 1)))
    (br_if $main_loop 
      (i32.lt_s (local.get $i) (local.get $array_length)))
  )
)
```

**Result:** Loop fusion works excellently in WASM, potentially with better performance than Z80 due to modern CPU optimizations.

## 8. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 8.1 Major Challenges

#### **Type System Mapping**
MinZ's precise integer types (u8, i8, u16, i16) map well to WASM's i32/i64, but require careful handling of overflow semantics.

#### **Memory Layout**
Z80's memory-mapped I/O and specific address spaces need simulation in WASM's linear memory model.

#### **Inline Assembly**
MinZ's `@abi` annotations have no WASM equivalent - need alternative foreign function interface.

### 8.2 Proposed Solutions

#### **Type Safety Preservation**
```wasm
;; Wrap all operations to maintain MinZ semantics
(func $minz_u8_add (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
  (i32.and 
    (i32.add (local.get $a) (local.get $b))
    (i32.const 0xFF)  ;; Ensure u8 bounds
  )
)
```

#### **Virtual Memory Mapping**
```wasm
;; Simulate Z80 memory map in linear memory
(memory $z80_mem 1)  ;; 64KB linear memory
(global $io_base i32 (i32.const 0xFF00))  ;; I/O addresses

(func $memory_mapped_read (param $addr i32) (result i32)
  ;; Check if I/O address and handle specially
  ;; Otherwise, normal memory access
)
```
