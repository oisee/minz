## 🎵 The Compiler Dance (to the tune of "We Will Rock You")

```
COMPILE! *clap* *clap*
TIME! *clap* *clap*
EXECUTE! *clap* *clap*
OPTIMIZE!

We will, we will, CTIE YOU! 
We will, we will, CTIE YOU!

Functions vanish in the night
Constants shining oh so bright
Z80 running at the speed of light
We will, we will, CTIE YOU!
```

## 💃 The Assembly Shuffle

```asm
; Before CTIE (The Sad Shuffle)
CALL add_const    ; 😢 17 cycles
LD A, (result)    ; 😔 +13 cycles  
RET               ; 😭 +10 cycles

; After CTIE (The Victory Boogie!)
LD A, 8           ; 🎉 7 cycles TOTAL!
                  ; 🕺 DANCE PARTY!
```

    "Wait... those arguments are constants..." 🤔
    
ACT III: The Execution
    "Let's just... run it now?" 💡

## 🎪 The Circus of Impossibilities

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, witness the IMPOSSIBLE:

```
    🎪 THE AMAZING VANISHING FUNCTION! 🎪
    
    Watch as factorial(5) becomes... 120!
    See multiply(6, 7) transform into... 42!
    Behold add(10, 20) disappear into... 30!
    
    No smoke! No mirrors! Just COMPILE-TIME MAGIC!
```

## 🎶 The Ballad of CTIE

```
🎵 Once upon a compile time,
   Functions cost us cycles prime,
   Stack and calls and overhead,
   Made our Z80s feel half-dead...

   But then came CTIE, shining bright!
   Executing in the compiler's light!
   Constants computed, calls erased,
   Performance problems now displaced!

   Oh CTIE, CTIE, you're so fine!
   You execute at compile time!
   Functions vanish, code runs free,
   Negative cost for you and me! 🎵
```

              Oh wait, I'm already here! 
              Been here for 37 cycles! 
              Made some coffee! ☕"

**WILL be computed at compile-time...**  
**And then it will DISAPPEAR!"**
