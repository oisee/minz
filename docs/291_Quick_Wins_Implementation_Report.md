# Quick Wins Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented two critical Quick Wins (QW3 & QW4) from the QW-MW-SW analysis, resulting in a 7% improvement in compilation success rate.

## Implemented Fixes

### QW3: Fix Parameter Scope Bug in Recursive Functions ✅
**Problem:** Recursive functions were incorrectly using Self-Modifying Code (SMC) for parameters, causing "parameter not found" errors during code generation.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Semantic analyzer allowed SMC for recursive functions with ≤3 parameters
2. Inliner was copying OpLoadParam instructions without remapping parameters

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Fixed semantic analyzer** (`pkg/semantic/analyzer.go:1412-1416`):
   - Disabled SMC for ALL recursive functions
   - Added clear comment explaining why SMC doesn't work with recursion
   
2. **Fixed inliner** (`pkg/optimizer/inlining.go:72-78`):
   - Added check to prevent inlining functions with OpLoadParam instructions
   - Added TODO for proper parameter remapping in future

**Impact:** 
- Fixed 4 failing recursive function tests
- Enabled tail recursion optimization to work properly
- fibonacci_tail.minz now compiles successfully

### QW4: Suppress Optimizer Noise ✅
**Problem:** Optimizer passes were outputting verbose diagnostics even in normal mode.

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `pkg/optimizer/tail_recursion.go` and `recursion_detector.go`
- Added check for `MINZ_QUIET` environment variable
- Only show diagnostics when DEBUG=1 and MINZ_QUIET is not set

**Impact:**
- Cleaner compilation output
- Better user experience
- Diagnostic info still available with DEBUG=1

## Results

### Compilation Success Rate
- **Before fixes:** 67% (39/58 examples)
- **After fixes:** 74% (43/58 examples)  
- **Improvement:** +7% (4 additional examples now compile)

### Fixed Examples
- `fibonacci_tail.minz` - Tail recursive Fibonacci
- `test_recursive_param.minz` - Recursive factorial
- Other recursive function examples

## Technical Details

### SMC and Recursion Incompatibility
Self-Modifying Code optimization patches parameters directly into instruction immediates. This works for non-recursive functions but fails for recursive ones because:
- Each recursive call needs different parameter values
- SMC patches would overwrite previous call's parameters
- Stack-based parameter passing is required for recursion

### Inliner Parameter Mapping Issue
The function inliner was generating invalid code by:
- Copying OpLoadParam instructions from inlined functions
- Not mapping these to actual argument values
- Causing "parameter not found" errors in calling functions

## Next Steps

### Remaining Quick Wins
- QW1: Remove :: enum notation (2 hours)
- QW2: Document module import system (1 hour)
- QW5: Add missing built-ins: pad(), format() (1 hour)

### Critical Medium Wins
- MW3: Fix pattern matching nil expressions (2 days)
- MW1: Complete error propagation with ?? operator (3 days)
- MW2: Implement self parameter & method calls (4 days)

## Conclusion
The parameter scope bug was a critical issue affecting all recursive functions. By disabling SMC for recursive functions and preventing improper inlining, we've restored proper recursion support and improved the overall compilation success rate significantly.
