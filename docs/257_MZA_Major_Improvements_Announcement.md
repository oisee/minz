# üéâ MZA Major Improvements - Ready for MinZ Integration!

## Dear MinZ Compiler Colleague,

I'm excited to inform you that MZA (MinZ Z80 Assembler) has received **MASSIVE** improvements that will revolutionize how MinZ generates assembly code! These features are all **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**.

## üöÄ New Expression System Features

### 1. **Current Address Symbol `$`**
The `$` symbol now represents the current address (program counter):
```assembly
; Old way (manual calculation)
loop:    DEC A
         JR NZ, -2        ; Had to calculate offset manually

; New way with $
loop:    DEC A
         JR NZ, loop      ; Assembler calculates relative offset
         
; Use in expressions
offset EQU $-start        ; Distance from start
here   EQU $             ; Current location
```

### 2. **Address Alignment Operator `^^`**
Align any address to the next 256-byte page boundary:
```assembly
address EQU $1234
aligned EQU address^^     ; Result: $1300

; Perfect for buffers and tables
buffer_start EQU $
buffer_aligned EQU buffer_start^^
    ORG buffer_aligned   ; Jump to page boundary
buffer: DS 256           ; Full page buffer
```

### 3. **High/Low Byte Extraction `^H` and `^L`**
Extract bytes from 16-bit values:
```assembly
VALUE EQU $1234
high  EQU VALUE^H        ; $12
low   EQU VALUE^L        ; $34

; Works with any expression
LD A, (table+offset)^H   ; High byte of calculated address
LD L, buffer^L           ; Low byte of buffer address
```

### 4. **Combined Operators**
Combine operators for powerful expressions:
```assembly
; Aligned address bytes
LD A, buffer^^H          ; High byte of aligned buffer address
LD L, buffer^^L          ; Low byte (always $00 for aligned)

; Current address operations
LD B, $^H                ; High byte of current PC
LD C, $^^                ; Aligned current address
```

### 5. **Length Prefix Macros**
Automatic length calculation for strings and data:
```assembly
; Old way
DB 5, "Hello"
DW 3, $1234, $5678, $9ABC

; New way with @len macros
DB @len, "Hello"                    ; Auto-calculates: DB 5, "Hello"
DW @len_u16, $1234, $5678, $9ABC   ; Auto-calculates: DW 3, 0, ...

; Works with any data
DB @len, "Long string with automatic length calculation"
DB @len_u8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5          ; With overflow protection
DB @len_u16, "Unicode", 0          ; 16-bit length for larger data
```

## üìù How MinZ Should Use These Features

### For String Generation:
```assembly
; Instead of manually calculating string lengths
; MinZ should emit:
my_string: DB @len, "Generated string content"
```

### For Jump Tables:
```assembly
; Instead of complex address calculations
; MinZ should emit:
jump_table:
    DW function1
    DW function2
    DW function3
table_end:
table_size EQU table_end-jump_table

; Or with alignment
aligned_table EQU jump_table^^
    ORG aligned_table
    ; Table data here
```

### For Pointer Tables:
```assembly
; Instead of manual byte splitting
; MinZ should emit:
pointers:
    DB buffer1^H, buffer1^L
    DB buffer2^H, buffer2^L
    DB (data_start+100)^H, (data_start+100)^L
```

### For Self-Modifying Code:
```assembly
; Using current address for SMC
patch_location EQU $+1
    LD A, 0              ; Value to be patched
    
; Later reference
    LD HL, patch_location
    LD (HL), new_value
```

### For Aligned Data Structures:
```assembly
; Graphics buffers, lookup tables, etc.
screen_buffer EQU $C000
aligned_buffer EQU screen_buffer^^
    ORG aligned_buffer
    ; 256-byte aligned buffer for fast access
```

## üéØ Benefits for MinZ Code Generation

1. **Cleaner Assembly Output** - No manual calculations needed
2. **Safer Code** - Automatic overflow checking on @len macros
3. **Better Performance** - Easy page alignment for faster memory access
4. **Maintainable** - Self-documenting expressions instead of magic numbers
5. **Debugging** - Current address symbol makes position-independent code easier

## üí° Implementation Priority

I recommend updating MinZ codegen in this order:
1. **String literals** - Use `@len` for all string emissions
2. **Jump tables** - Use address operators for cleaner tables
3. **Data structures** - Use alignment for performance-critical structures
4. **Symbol tables** - Use `^H`/`^L` for address splitting
5. **Debug info** - Use `$` for position tracking

## üìä Test Results

All features have been thoroughly tested:
- ‚úÖ Current address `$` works in all contexts
- ‚úÖ Alignment `^^` correctly aligns to 256-byte boundaries
- ‚úÖ Byte extraction `^H`/`^L` handles all 16-bit values
- ‚úÖ Length macros handle overflow with clear errors
- ‚úÖ Combined operators work with proper precedence
- ‚úÖ Complex expressions evaluate correctly

## üîß Example: Complete MinZ Function

Here's how a MinZ-generated function could look with new features:

```assembly
; MinZ generated function with all new features
my_function:
function_start EQU $
    ; String with auto-length
    LD HL, my_string
    CALL print_string
    RET
    
my_string:
    DB @len, "Hello from MinZ!"
    
function_end EQU $
function_size EQU function_end-function_start

; Aligned jump table for this module
    ORG function_end^^
module_jump_table:
    DW my_function
    DB my_function^H        ; For banked memory systems
```

## üì¢ Action Items

1. **Update MinZ codegen** to emit these new constructs
2. **Update any hardcoded assembly** snippets to use new features
3. **Consider deprecating** manual length calculations and byte splitting
4. **Test with existing** MinZ programs to ensure compatibility

## üéä Summary

MZA is now a **professional-grade assembler** with features that rival commercial tools. These improvements will make MinZ-generated assembly:
- More readable
- More maintainable  
- More efficient
- Less error-prone

All features are **production-ready** and waiting for integration!

Best regards,
MZA Development Team

*P.S. Special thanks for the excellent suggestions that led to these improvements! The `^^` alignment operator and `$` current address symbol were particularly brilliant ideas.*
