## Bug Fix Impact Analysis

### Parameter Passing Resolution

The critical bug where the second `LD A` instruction overwrote the first parameter has been resolved. Testing shows:

- Function calls with multiple parameters now compile correctly
- Register allocation properly preserves parameter values
- SMC optimizations work correctly with multi-parameter functions

### Before vs After Comparison

Prior to the fix, functions with multiple 8-bit parameters would exhibit incorrect behavior due to register overwriting. The fixed compiler now:

1. **Properly sequences parameter loading**
2. **Maintains parameter integrity during function calls** 
3. **Correctly applies SMC optimizations without corrupting parameters**

## Error Pattern Analysis


### Common Compilation Issues

The following error patterns were identified during testing:

- **** (1 occurrences)

## Performance Analysis

### Code Generation Efficiency

The compiler generates efficient Z80 assembly code with:

- Optimized register allocation reducing memory access
- SMC optimizations providing runtime performance improvements
- Compact instruction sequences minimizing code size

### Optimization Impact

Files that successfully compiled with both standard and optimized builds showed measurable improvements in:

1. **Code size reduction** through dead code elimination
2. **Register usage optimization** reducing stack operations
3. **SMC parameter injection** eliminating runtime lookups
