# MinZ Compiler Progress Report

## Session Summary

### Achievements
1. ✅ **Performed comprehensive Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identified 8 distinct failure patterns
   - Prioritized fixes based on impact

2. ✅ **Created high-level development plan**
   - 12-week roadmap to production readiness
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Clear success metrics

3. ✅ **Clarified pointer philosophy**
   - Documented decision to keep explicit pointers
   - Created POINTER_PHILOSOPHY.md
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with design rationale

4. ✅ **Implemented bitwise operators**
   - Added parenthesized expression support
   - Added unary expression parsing (including `~`)
   - Fixed binary operator extraction from source
   - Added OpNot code generation with CPL instruction
   - All shift operations now working

### Technical Changes

#### Parser Updates (`sexp_parser.go`)
- Added `parenthesized_expression` case
- Added `unary_expression` case with proper operator extraction
- Fixed source code operator extraction for unary operators

#### Code Generator Updates (`z80.go`)
- Enhanced OpNot to handle 8-bit vs 16-bit operations
- Uses CPL instruction for bitwise complement
- Proper type checking for operation size

### Compilation Statistics
- **Before**: 48/96 (50.00%) 
- **After**: 51/96 (53.12%)
- **Improvement**: +3 examples now compile

### Fixed Examples
- ✅ `bit_manipulation.minz` - All bitwise operations working
- ✅ Additional bitwise examples

### Still Failing (Related to Bitwise)
- ❌ `bit_fields.minz` - Struct issues, not operator issues
- ❌ `math_functions.minz` - Cast expression issues
- ❌ `performance_tricks.minz` - Cast expression issues

## Next Priority: Pointer Dereferencing

The next critical feature is implementing the `*ptr` operator for pointer dereferencing. This will unlock:
- String operations
- Memory manipulation
- Data structure traversal
- Array processing

### Implementation Plan
1. Add `*` unary operator handling in semantic analyzer
2. Generate proper indirect load/store instructions
3. Handle both read (`x = *ptr`) and write (`*ptr = x`) cases
4. Test with string_operations.minz and pointer_arithmetic.minz

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tree-sitter Integration**: The S-expression format requires careful operator extraction from source code
2. **Type-aware Codegen**: Z80 requires different instructions for 8-bit vs 16-bit operations
3. **Incremental Progress**: Even small fixes (3% improvement) are valuable steps forward

## Recommendation

Continue with pointer dereferencing implementation to achieve the next major jump in compilation success rate. This single feature will likely fix 15-20% of failing examples.
