# TRUE SMC Implementation Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Document**: 020_TRUE_SMC_Progress_Report.md

## Executive Summary

The TRUE SMC (–∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–Ω—ã–π SMC) implementation has reached a functional state with core anchor generation working correctly. This report summarizes the current state, progress made, and remaining work.

## 1. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Design ‚úÖ
- Analyzed articles 009/010 (ADR-001 and SPEC v0.1)
- Understood TRUE SMC concepts and Z80 constraints
- Created initial design document (014)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ‚úÖ
- Implemented CFG analysis for anchor placement
- Created anchor generation with immediate operands
- Added PATCH-TABLE data structures
- Integrated with IR and code generation

### Phase 3: User Feedback Integration ‚úÖ
- Removed unnecessary DI/EI protection (Z80 instructions are atomic)
- Implemented EQU-based anchor addressing for clarity
- Updated design document (018) with corrections

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes ‚úÖ
- Fixed parameter index tracking in semantic analyzer
- Fixed anchor assignment bug (both params using same anchor)
- Verified both 8-bit and 16-bit anchor generation

## 2. Current Implementation Status

### Working Features ‚úÖ
1. **Anchor Generation**
   - 8-bit immediates: `LD A, n` with `x$imm0 EQU x$immOP+1`
   - 16-bit immediates: `LD HL, nn` with `x$imm0 EQU x$immOP+1`
   - Multiple parameters get unique anchors

2. **Optimizer Integration**
   - TRUE SMC pass integrated into optimization pipeline
   - Now default optimization (as of this commit)
   - Diagnostic support for debugging

3. **Code Generation**
   - Clean assembly output with comments
   - Proper EQU definitions
   - No unnecessary interrupt protection

### Example Output
```asm
; Function with TRUE SMC anchors
fn$name:
; TRUE SMC function with immediate anchors
x$immOP:
    LD A, 0        ; x anchor (will be patched)
x$imm0 EQU x$immOP+1
    LD ($F006), A
y$immOP:
    LD A, 0        ; y anchor (will be patched)
y$imm0 EQU y$immOP+1
    LD ($F008), A
```

## 3. Remaining Work

### High Priority üî¥
1. **Call-Site Patching** (Not Implemented)
   - Generate patching code before CALL instructions
   - Use anchor addresses to patch immediates
   - Handle recursive context correctly

2. **PATCH-TABLE Emission** (Not Implemented)
   - Emit patch table to assembly file
   - Include all anchor metadata
   - Format for runtime/loader consumption

### Medium Priority üü°
3. **Anchor Reuse Optimization**
   - Track parameter usage throughout function
   - Reuse anchor values when beneficial
   - Reduce redundant loads

4. **Prefixed Opcode Support**
   - Handle DD/FD prefixed instructions
   - Adjust EQU offsets (+2 or +3)
   - Test with IX/IY operations

### Low Priority üü¢
5. **Advanced Optimizations**
   - Cross-function anchor analysis
   - Dead anchor elimination
   - Anchor hoisting

## 4. Technical Debt

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Limited test suite (only basic cases)
   - Need comprehensive parameter type tests
   - Need recursive function tests

2. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for SMC conflicts
   - Validation of anchor placement
   - Warning for non-RAM code sections

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide for TRUE SMC features
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Migration guide from old SMC

## 5. Design Decisions

### Why TRUE SMC by Default?
- This is the core innovation of MinZ language
- Enables ultra-fast function calls (no stack operations)
- Natural fit for Z80 architecture
- Backwards compatible with disable flag

### Why EQU Approach?
- Clearer assembly code
- Better debugger support
- Standard Z80 idiom
- No runtime overhead

### Why No DI/EI?
- Z80 completes instructions atomically
- Interrupts wait for instruction completion
- Simpler and faster code
- Follows modern Z80 best practices

## 6. Performance Impact

### Expected Benefits
- **Call Overhead**: ~90% reduction (4 T-states vs 40+)
- **Parameter Passing**: Direct immediate operands
- **Memory Usage**: No stack for parameters
- **Code Size**: Slight increase for anchors, major decrease for calls

### Trade-offs
- Code must be in RAM for patching
- Small overhead for anchor generation
- Slightly larger function preambles

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Implement Call-Site Patching** (Today)
   - Add OpTrueSMCPatch generation
   - Update code generator
   - Test with real function calls

2. **Emit PATCH-TABLE** (Today)
   - Design assembly format
   - Generate table at end of code
   - Add loader documentation

3. **Comprehensive Testing** (This Week)
   - Create test suite
   - Benchmark performance
   - Validate edge cases

## 8. Conclusion

The TRUE SMC implementation has successfully reached a functional state with correct anchor generation. The system now generates efficient Z80 code that can be patched at runtime for ultra-fast function calls. With TRUE SMC as the default optimization, MinZ is positioned as a unique systems programming language optimized for Z80's architectural strengths.
