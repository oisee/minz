# MinZ Examples Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. Archived Future/Complex Features (32 files)
Moved to `archived_future_features/` directory:
- Complex module system examples (modules/*)
- Union types and pattern matching examples
- Complex state machines and parsers
- Advanced inline assembly with interpolation
- Experimental loop constructs (loop...into)
- Complex zvdb implementations

### 2. Fixed Syntax Issues
- **mnist_complete.minz**: Changed `do 32 times` → `while i < 32`
- **mnist_simple.minz**: Changed `fn` → `fun`, removed module declarations
- **test_const_simple_fix.minz**: Moved const to global scope
- **test_true_smc_call.minz**: Removed qualified function calls
- **main.minz**: Simplified inline assembly (removed interpolation)

### 3. Kept Core Features
These examples align with генплан and remain:
- Basic SMC optimization examples
- @abi integration examples
- Lua metaprogramming examples
- Basic structs and arrays
- Tail recursion examples
- Register allocation demos

## Results
- **Before cleanup**: 144 examples
- **After cleanup**: 112 examples
- **Archived**: 32 examples for future phases

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic import/export mechanism
2. Add simple inline assembly support
3. Complete Lua metaprogramming integration
4. Fix remaining compilation issues in cleaned examples

The cleanup focused on keeping examples that demonstrate MinZ's core revolutionary features:
- TRUE SMC optimization
- TSMC references
- @abi seamless assembly integration
- Z80-specific optimizations
- Lua metaprogramming

Complex features like generics, pattern matching, and advanced module systems have been archived for future implementation phases.
