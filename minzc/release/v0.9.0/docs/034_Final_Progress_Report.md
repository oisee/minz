# MinZ Compiler Progress Report - Final Update

## Summary
Successfully improved MinZ compiler compilation rate from **46.7%** to **55.0%** (66/120 files).

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Built-in Functions Implementation
- Added `print()`, `len()`, `memcpy()`, `memset()` as compiler built-ins
- Created special IR opcodes for these functions
- Implemented Z80 assembly generation for each built-in
- Fixed type compatibility between arrays and pointers

### 2. Pointer Operations
- Fixed pointer dereference assignment (`*ptr = value`)
- Added UnaryExpr case in analyzeAssignment()
- Improved type checking for pointer operations

### 3. Arithmetic Operations
- Implemented OpNeg (unary minus) for both 8-bit and 16-bit values
- Fixed IR String() method for missing opcodes (OpAnd, OpXor, OpShr, etc.)
- All arithmetic opcodes now properly display in debug output

### 4. Language Features
- Added support for `let mut` variable declarations
- Updated grammar.js to support optional 'mut' keyword
- Regenerated tree-sitter parser

### 5. Parser Improvements
- Fixed tree-sitter directory finding algorithm
- Parser now searches for grammar.js in parent directories
- Resolved "No language found" errors

## Technical Details

### IR Opcode String Representations Added
```go
case OpMod:    "r%d = r%d %% r%d"
case OpNeg:    "r%d = -r%d"
case OpAnd:    "r%d = r%d & r%d"
case OpOr:     "r%d = r%d | r%d"
case OpXor:    "r%d = r%d ^ r%d"
case OpShl:    "r%d = r%d << r%d"
case OpShr:    "r%d = r%d >> r%d"
case OpPrint:  "print(r%d)"
case OpLen:    "r%d = len(r%d)"
case OpMemcpy: "memcpy([r%d], [r%d], r%d)"
case OpMemset: "memset([r%d], r%d, r%d)"
```

### Z80 Code Generation Examples

#### OpNeg (Unary Minus)
```asm
; 8-bit negation
LD A, L       ; Get low byte
NEG           ; Negate A
LD L, A       ; Store back
LD H, 0       ; Clear high byte
```

#### Built-in Print
```asm
RST 16        ; Print character in A
```

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **Inline Assembly**: Expression parsing not implemented
2. **Cast Expressions**: Partially implemented, needs completion

### Medium Priority
1. **Address Calculation**: Local arrays need proper addressing
2. **Function Address Operator**: `&function_name` not implemented
3. **Unknown Op 62**: Address-of operation needs implementation

### Low Priority
1. **Lua Metaprogramming**: No support yet
2. **Match/Case Expressions**: Code generation missing

## Files Compilation Status

### Now Compiling (66 files)
- All basic arithmetic and control flow
- Simple functions and recursion
- Arrays and strings
- Pointer operations
- Built-in functions
- Mutable variables

### Still Failing (54 files)
- Inline assembly usage
- Complex data structures
- Bit field operations
- Import statements
- Lua metaprogramming
- Cast expressions
- Advanced SMC features

## Next Steps
1. Complete cast expression implementation
2. Add inline assembly expression parsing
3. Implement function address operator
4. Fix local array addressing
5. Add import statement support

The compiler has reached a stable 55% success rate with core language features working properly.
