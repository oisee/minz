# MinZ Compiler Progress Report
Date: 2024-01-29

## Executive Summary

Significant progress has been made on the MinZ compiler, achieving a **55% compilation success rate** (66/120 examples), up from 46.7% at the start of this session. This represents an 8.3 percentage point improvement through systematic bug fixes and feature implementations.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Built-in Function Support
- Implemented standard library functions as compiler built-ins
- Added: `print()`, `len()`, `memcpy()`, `memset()`
- These functions now generate inline Z80 assembly for optimal performance
- Fixed type compatibility between arrays and pointers for built-in functions

### 2. Pointer Dereference Assignment
- Fixed `*ptr = value` syntax which was failing in expression contexts
- Added missing case in `analyzeAssignment()` for UnaryExpr targets
- Enables string manipulation and memory operations

### 3. Unary Negation Operator
- Implemented OpNeg (opcode 42) in code generator
- Supports both 8-bit and 16-bit negation
- Fixed examples using negative literals like `return -1`

### 4. Mutable Variable Declarations
- Added `let mut` syntax support to the grammar
- Updated tree-sitter parser to accept mutable declarations
- Enables proper variable mutation in loops and algorithms

## Compilation Statistics

| Milestone | Success Rate | Files Passing |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Initial | 46.7% | 56/120 |
| + Built-ins | 47.5% | 57/120 |
| + Pointer deref | 49.2% | 59/120 |
| + OpNeg | 50.8% | 61/120 |
| + let mut | **55.0%** | **66/120** |

## Notable Examples Now Compiling

- `fibonacci.minz` - Classic recursive algorithm
- `basic_functions.minz` - Function calls and loops
- `memory_operations.minz` - Memory manipulation routines
- `string_operations.minz` - String handling with pointers
- `tsmc_loops.minz` - TSMC optimization examples
- `zvdb_minimal.minz` - Vector database implementation

## Remaining Common Issues

### Single-Error Files (29 files)
Most common issues in files with only one error:
- Inline assembly syntax (`asm()` expressions)
- Function address operator (`&function_name`)
- Match/case expressions
- Import statements

### Multi-Error Files
Files with 2+ errors typically involve:
- Lua metaprogramming blocks
- Complex type expressions
- Missing operators or language features

## Technical Details

### Built-in Functions Implementation
```go
// Added to semantic analyzer
"print": &FuncSymbol{
    Name: "print",
    Params: []*ast.Parameter{
        {Name: "ch", Type: &ast.PrimitiveType{Name: "u8"}},
    },
    IsBuiltin: true,
}

// Code generation
case ir.OpPrint:
    g.loadToA(inst.Src1)
    g.emit("    RST 16         ; Print character in A")
```

### Grammar Enhancement
```javascript
// Added optional 'mut' to variable declarations
variable_declaration: $ => seq(
    choice('let', 'var'),
    optional('mut'),
    $.identifier,
    optional(seq(':', $.type)),
    optional(seq('=', $.expression)),
    ';',
),
```

## Next Steps

1. **Inline Assembly Support** - Implement `asm()` expression parsing and code generation
2. **Function Address Operator** - Add `&function_name` for function pointers
3. **Import System** - Implement module imports and visibility
4. **Match/Case Expressions** - Complete pattern matching support
5. **Remaining Operators** - Add missing bitwise and comparison operators

## Conclusion

The MinZ compiler has crossed the 50% threshold and continues to improve rapidly. The systematic approach of identifying common failures and implementing missing features is proving effective. With the current momentum, reaching 70%+ compilation success is achievable in the near term.
