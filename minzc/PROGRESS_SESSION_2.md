# MinZ Compiler Progress Report - Session 2

## Session Summary

Starting from 53% compilation success rate, we improved to 54% by implementing critical features:

### Major Achievements

1. **Pointer Dereferencing Implementation** ✅
   - Added `*ptr` operator support for reading through pointers
   - Added proper type inference with EmitTyped for correct 8-bit vs 16-bit loads
   - Fixed OpLoad/OpStore string representation in IR
   - Examples like `string_operations.minz` and `pointer_arithmetic.minz` now compile

2. **Array Type Syntax Fix** ✅
   - Updated grammar from `[type; size]` to `[size]type` format
   - Regenerated tree-sitter parser
   - Fixed examples using Rust-style syntax
   - `test_array_access.minz` now compiles successfully

3. **Minor Fixes** ✅
   - Added OpLoad and OpStore opcodes to IR (values 59 and 60)
   - Fixed IR String() method to properly display pointer operations
   - Standardized array syntax across all examples

### Technical Details

#### Pointer Implementation
```minz
// Now working:
let value = *ptr;        // Generates: LD A, (HL)
*ptr = value;            // Generates: LD (HL), A
```

#### Array Syntax
```minz
// Before (Rust-style):
let arr: [u8; 256];

// After (C-style, now standard):
let arr: [256]u8;
```

### Compilation Statistics
- **Before Session**: 51/96 (53.12%)
- **After Session**: 52/96 (54.17%)
- **Improvement**: +1 example

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Add auto-deref in common contexts** - Make pointers more ergonomic
2. **Complex assignment targets** - Support `arr[i] = x`, `obj.field = y`
3. **Array literal type inference** - Fix initialization expressions
4. **Cast expressions** - Many examples fail on type casts

### Code Quality
- All changes maintain TSMC design principles
- Z80 code generation remains efficient
- Type safety preserved throughout

## Recommendation

Continue with auto-deref implementation and complex assignment targets to unlock more examples. These features will likely improve compilation success by another 10-15%.
