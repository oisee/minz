; Simple test of address alignment operator ^^
    ORG $8000

; Test values from the user example
address EQU $1234
aligned_address EQU address^^   ; Should be $1300

; Basic alignment test
test:
    ; Display the alignment results
    LD A, address           ; $34 (low byte of $1234)
    LD B, aligned_address   ; $00 (low byte of $1300)
    
    ; Test high bytes  
    LD C, address^H         ; $12 (high byte of $1234)
    LD D, aligned_address^H ; $13 (high byte of $1300)
