# Assignment and Control Flow Implementation

Date: 2025-07-28

## Overview

This document details the successful implementation of assignment statements, compound assignment operators, and related control flow enhancements in the MinZ compiler.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Basic Assignment Statements

Successfully implemented full assignment statement support for the MinZ language:

```minz
let x: u8 = 10;
x = 20;  // Basic assignment
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Added `analyzeAssignStmt()` in semantic analyzer
- Support for both mutable (`let`) and immutable (`const`) variables
- Proper type checking during assignment
- TSMC-aware assignment for self-modifying code optimization

### 2. Complex Assignment Targets

Implemented assignment to complex targets:

```minz
// Array element assignment
arr[i] = value;

// Struct field assignment  
obj.field = value;

// Pointer dereference assignment
*ptr = value;
```

**Implementation Highlights:**
- `IndexExpr` handling for array indexing
- `FieldExpr` handling for struct field access
- Automatic pointer dereferencing in assignment contexts
- Proper offset calculation for struct fields

### 3. Compound Assignment Operators

Added support for all compound assignment operators:

```minz
x += 5;   // Addition assignment
x -= 3;   // Subtraction assignment
x *= 2;   // Multiplication assignment
x /= 4;   // Division assignment
x %= 3;   // Modulo assignment
```

**Technical Details:**
- Grammar updates to include compound operators
- Desugaring approach: `x += y` â†’ `x = x + y`
- Works with all assignment targets (arrays, structs, etc.)
- Full support for both 8-bit and 16-bit operations

### 4. Range Expressions and For-In Loops

Implemented range expressions for iteration:

```minz
for i in 0..10 {
    // Loop body
}
```

**Features:**
- Range expression syntax (`start..end`)
- Efficient register-based iteration
- Proper scope handling for loop variables

### 5. Let Variable Mutability Fix

Fixed a critical issue where `let` variables were incorrectly marked as immutable:

**Before:**
```minz
let sum: u8 = 0;
sum = sum + 1;  // Error: cannot assign to immutable variable
```

**After:**
```minz
let sum: u8 = 0;
sum = sum + 1;  // Works correctly
```

**Fix Details:**
- Updated both tree-sitter parser (`parser.go`) and S-expression parser (`sexp_parser.go`)
- Changed `let` variables to be mutable by default in MinZ
- Aligned with MinZ design philosophy where `let` = mutable, `const` = immutable

## Code Generation Examples

### Assignment with TSMC Optimization

For TSMC-enabled functions, assignments patch immediate values directly:

```z80
; x = 42 (TSMC assignment)
LD A, 42
LD (patch_x+1), A  ; Patch immediate value
```

### Compound Assignment Code

```z80
; x += 5
LD A, (x)      ; Load current value
ADD A, 5       ; Add immediate
LD (x), A      ; Store result
```

### Array Assignment Code

```z80
; arr[i] = value
LD HL, arr     ; Base address
LD D, 0
LD E, (i)      ; Index
ADD HL, DE     ; Calculate element address
LD A, (value)
LD (HL), A     ; Store to array element
```

## Testing Results

Created comprehensive test files demonstrating all features:

1. **test_assignment.minz** - Basic assignment operations
2. **test_complex_assignments.minz** - Array and struct assignments
3. **test_compound_assignment.minz** - All compound operators
4. **test_range.minz** - Range expressions and for-in loops

All tests compile successfully and generate correct Z80 assembly.

## Impact on Compilation Success

The let variable mutability fix had significant impact:
- **Before**: 47/120 examples compiled (39%)
- **After**: 53/120 examples compiled (44%)
- **Improvement**: +6 examples now compile successfully

Examples that now work include:
- `control_flow.minz` - While loops with mutable counters
- Various examples using accumulator patterns
- Loop-based algorithms requiring mutable state

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Parser Token Confusion**: Fixed issue where GCC-style inline assembly was incorrectly parsed
2. **Type System Integration**: Ensured assignment type checking works with all MinZ types
3. **TSMC Coordination**: Properly integrated assignment with self-modifying code patterns
4. **Register Allocation**: Optimized register usage during complex assignments

## Future Considerations

While assignment and basic control flow are now fully functional, several areas remain for future work:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Assignment patterns for destructuring
2. **Multiple Assignment**: `let x, y = 1, 2` syntax
3. **Assignment Expressions**: Using assignment as an expression (currently statement-only)
4. **Optimization**: Further optimization of assignment sequences

## Conclusion

The implementation of assignment statements and related features represents a major milestone in MinZ compiler development. With these core language features working correctly, MinZ can now express complex algorithms and data manipulation patterns essential for Z80 programming.
