}

impl Drawable for Sprite {
    fun draw(self) -> void {
        // Direct assembly calls - zero overhead!
        screen.plot_sprite(self.x, self.y, self.data);
    }
}

// Beautiful explicit syntax
Sprite.draw(player);  // Compiles to direct function call!
```

### Why It's Retro-Futuristic Cool 🔥
