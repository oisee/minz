# MinZ v0.4.1 Session Progress Report

## Date: July 29, 2025

## Summary

This session successfully implemented several critical features for the MinZ compiler, improving the compilation success rate from 46.7% to 58.3%.

## Initial State
- Compilation success: 56/120 files (46.7%)
- Multiple missing features causing compilation failures

## Implemented Features

### 1. Built-in Functions (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added support for print(), len(), memcpy(), memset() as compiler built-ins
- Created special IR opcodes for each built-in function
- Implemented Z80 code generation for all built-ins
- Fixed type compatibility between arrays and pointers

### 2. Pointer Dereference Assignment (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added support for `*ptr = value` syntax in assignment context
- Fixed missing UnaryExpr case in analyzeAssignment()

### 3. Unary Minus Operator (✅ COMPLETED)
- Implemented OpNeg (opcode 42) in code generator
- Added support for both 8-bit and 16-bit negation

### 4. Mutable Variable Declarations (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added optional 'mut' keyword to grammar.js
- Regenerated tree-sitter parser
- Fixed parsing of `let mut x = value` syntax

### 5. Cast Expression Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Fixed tree-sitter S-expression parser to create proper CastExpr nodes
- Changed convertCastToBinary to convertCastExpr
- Fixed type parsing in cast expressions
- Cast expressions now work correctly (e.g., `x as u16`)

### 6. Inline Assembly Expression Parsing (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added parseInlineAssembly() function to parser
- Implemented parseStringLiteral() helper
- Fixed compilation errors and unused variable issues
- Added InlineAssembly support to semantic analyzer

### 7. Local Array Address Calculation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Fixed OpAddr implementation to use actual variable addresses
- Changed from placeholder addresses to calculated addresses using getAbsoluteAddr()
- Added String() representation for OpAddr

### 8. Function Address Operator (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added FuncSymbol handling in analyzeIdentifier
- Implemented OpLoadLabel for function references
- Fixed nil pointer dereference with proper type handling
- Function pointers now work correctly (e.g., `&callback`)

## Bug Fixes

### Parser Issues
- Fixed tree-sitter parser directory detection
- Resolved "No language found" error by implementing grammar.js search

### IR Debug Output
- Added missing String() cases for opcodes 45 (OpAnd), 47 (OpXor), 50 (OpShr)
- Fixed "unknown op" comments in generated assembly

## Final State
- Compilation success: 70/120 files (58.3%)
- Improvement: +14 files successfully compiling (+11.6%)

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
1. `pkg/semantic/analyzer.go`
   - Added built-in function definitions
   - Fixed pointer dereference assignment
   - Added cast expression analysis
   - Implemented function address handling

2. `pkg/ir/ir.go`
   - Added new opcodes for built-ins
   - Fixed String() method for all opcodes
   - Added missing type definitions

3. `pkg/codegen/z80.go`
   - Implemented code generation for built-in functions
   - Added OpNeg implementation
   - Fixed OpAddr to use real addresses

4. `pkg/parser/parser.go`
   - Added inline assembly parsing
   - Fixed directory finding for grammar.js
   - Implemented cast expression parsing

5. `pkg/parser/sexp_parser.go`
   - Changed cast expression handling from binary to proper CastExpr
   - Fixed type parsing in cast expressions

6. `grammar.js`
   - Added optional 'mut' keyword support

## Remaining High-Priority Issues

1. Bit struct implementation
2. Lua metaprogramming support
3. Match/case expression code generation
4. Array initializer improvements
5. Struct field access optimizations

## Next Steps

1. Implement bit struct support for examples like test_cast.minz
2. Add Lua metaprogramming to enable compile-time code generation
3. Fix remaining parsing and code generation issues
4. Continue improving compilation success rate toward 100%

## Release Notes

These improvements have been packaged into MinZ v0.4.1, which includes:
- Enhanced standard library support with built-in functions
- Complete cast expression implementation
- Function pointer support
- Improved pointer operations
- Better error messages and debugging
