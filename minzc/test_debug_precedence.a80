BASE EQU $1234
OFFSET EQU $100

; Step by step
test:
    LD A, OFFSET^H      ; $100^H = $01
    LD B, BASE          ; $1234 & $FF = $34 (truncated to 8-bit)
    LD C, BASE+1        ; ($1234 + 1) & $FF = $35
    
; The expression in question  
debug:
    LD A, BASE+OFFSET^H ; BASE + (OFFSET^H) = $1234 + $01 = $1235, truncated to $35
