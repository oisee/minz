# 026: Bit Structs Implementation Progress Report

## Completed Features

### 1. AST Support ✅
- Added `BitStructType` node with underlying type and fields
- Added `BitField` node with name, bit offset, and width
- Added `TypeDecl` node for type aliases including bit structs

### 2. Parser Support ✅
- Implemented parsing for `bits` keyword
- Support for optional underlying type: `bits<u16>`
- Bit field syntax: `field_name: bit_width`
- Integrated into simple parser (tree-sitter parser needs update)

### 3. Semantic Analysis ✅
- Type declarations properly registered in symbol table
- Bit field validation:
  - Width must be 1-16 bits
  - Total fields must fit in underlying type (8 or 16 bits)
  - Duplicate field names detected
- Type symbols created for use in variable declarations

### 4. IR Support ✅
- Added `BitStructType` with size calculation
- Added `BitField` with offset and width tracking
- Added `OpLoadBitField` and `OpStoreBitField` opcodes

### 5. Code Generation ✅
- Implemented efficient AND/OR/shift approach for bit fields
- `OpLoadBitField`: Shift right + AND mask
- `OpStoreBitField`: Clear bits with AND, shift new value, OR combine
- Generates optimal Z80 assembly for bit manipulation

## Example Usage

```minz
// Define 8-bit screen attributes
type ScreenAttr = bits {
    ink: 3,      // Bits 0-2
    paper: 3,    // Bits 3-5  
    bright: 1,   // Bit 6
    flash: 1     // Bit 7
};

// Define 16-bit sprite control
type SpriteCtrl = bits<u16> {
    x_pos: 9,      // Bits 0-8 (0-511)
    visible: 1,    // Bit 9
    collision: 1,  // Bit 10
    palette: 2,    // Bits 11-12
    priority: 2,   // Bits 13-14
    flip_x: 1      // Bit 15
};
```

## Generated Assembly Example

For reading a 3-bit field at offset 3:
```asm
LD A, source
SRL A       ; Shift right 3 times
SRL A
SRL A
AND 0x07    ; Mask to 3 bits
```

For writing a 3-bit field at offset 3:
```asm
LD A, source
AND 0xC7    ; Clear bits 3-5 (11000111)
LD B, A     ; Save cleared value
LD A, new_value
SLA A       ; Shift left 3 times
SLA A
SLA A
OR B        ; Combine
```

## Pending Features

### 1. Type Conversions (High Priority)
Need to implement cast expressions:
```minz
let attr: ScreenAttr = 0x47 as ScreenAttr
let raw: u8 = attr as u8
```

### 2. Field Access (High Priority)
Currently have IR support but need full integration:
```minz
let ink_color = attr.ink      // Read field
attr.paper = 5                 // Write field
```

### 3. Struct Literal Syntax (Medium Priority)
```minz
let attr: ScreenAttr = { 
    ink: 7, 
    paper: 0, 
    bright: true, 
    flash: false 
}
```

### 4. 16-bit Support (Medium Priority)
- Extend code generation to use HL register pair
- Handle 16-bit masks and shifts

### 5. Optimizations (Low Priority)
- Recognize adjacent fields that can be set together
- Use rotate instructions for power-of-2 offsets
- Inline constant masks at compile time

## Technical Decisions

1. **AND/OR vs BIT/SET/RES**: Chose AND/OR with shifts because:
   - Works for multi-bit fields (not just single bits)
   - Often faster or equal performance
   - More consistent code generation
   - Better optimization opportunities

2. **Compile-time Resolution**: All bit field offsets and masks are computed at compile time for zero runtime overhead

3. **Type Safety**: Bit structs are distinct types, preventing accidental mixing with their underlying types

## Next Steps

1. Implement cast expressions in parser and semantic analyzer
2. Complete field access integration 
3. Add comprehensive tests for 8-bit operations
4. Implement 16-bit bit struct support
5. Add struct literal initialization

The foundation is solid and the most complex parts (parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation strategy) are complete. The remaining work is mostly integration and syntax sugar.
