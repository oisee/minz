# Root Cause Analysis: MNIST Editor Compilation Issues

Date: 2025-07-23

## Issue #006 & #007: Module Import System Not Working

### Root Cause
The module import system is not implemented in the semantic analyzer. When analyzing imports, the analyzer doesn't:
1. Load and parse the imported module files
2. Add imported types to the type system
3. Add imported functions to the symbol table

### Evidence
- No module resolution logic in semantic analyzer
- ImportStmt is parsed but not processed
- ModuleResolver interface exists but has no implementation

## Issue #008: Const Keyword Not Recognized

### Root Cause
The parser treats "const" as a type name rather than a type modifier. The type parsing logic doesn't handle type qualifiers.

### Evidence
- In `parseType()`, only primitive types and type identifiers are recognized
- No support for type modifiers like `const`, `mut`, etc.
- The error shows "undefined type: const" indicating it's being parsed as a type name

## Issue #009: Field Expression Type Inference Missing

### Root Cause
The `inferType()` function doesn't have a case for `*ast.FieldExpr`, so it falls through to the default error case.

### Evidence
- Error message: "cannot infer type from expression of type *ast.FieldExpr"
- `inferType()` switch statement lacks FieldExpr case
- Field expressions are analyzed but their types cannot be inferred

## Issue #010: Cross-Module Function Calls

### Root Cause
This is a consequence of Issue #007. Since imported modules aren't processed, their functions aren't available in the symbol table.

### Evidence
- "undefined function: editor_init" 
- Function is defined in imported module but not accessible
- Symbol table only contains local definitions

## Summary of Required Fixes

1. **Implement Module Import System**
   - Create ModuleResolver implementation
   - Load and parse imported files
   - Merge imported symbols into current scope
   - Handle circular dependencies

2. **Add Const Type Modifier Support**
   - Update parser to recognize type qualifiers
   - Implement ConstType wrapper or modifier flag
   - Update type compatibility checking

3. **Add Field Expression Type Inference**
   - Implement FieldExpr case in inferType()
   - Look up struct type from object expression
   - Find field type in struct definition

4. **Fix Variable Allocation**
   - Current implementation allocates all variables at $F000
   - Need proper offset calculation for local variables
