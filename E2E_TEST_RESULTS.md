# E2E Regression Test Results

## Summary
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Total Files Tested**: 87
- **Successful**: 56  
- **Failed**: 31
- **Success Rate**: 64%

## Improvements Made Today

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
1. **Operator Precedence** - Swapped unary (now 9) and cast (now 8) precedence
   - Fixes: `*data as u16` now correctly dereferences then casts
   
2. **Pointer Arithmetic** - Added support in `inferType` 
   - Fixes: `ptr + integer` and `integer + ptr` expressions work
   
3. **Pointer-to-Integer Casts** - Updated `isValidCast`
   - Fixes: Allows casting pointer values to integers
   
4. **Self Parameter** - Parser detects and sets IsSelf flag
   - Fixes: Method syntax with explicit self type

### üìä Categories Performance

| Category | Success | Total | Rate |
|----------|---------|-------|------|
| Examples | 45 | 58 | 78% |
| Feature Tests | 2 | 11 | 18% |
| Standard Library | 2 | 11 | 18% |
| Games | 3 | 4 | 75% |
| Regression Tests | 3 | 3 | 100% |

### ‚ùå Main Failure Patterns

1. **Missing Functions** (12 files)
   - Undefined functions like `set_pixel`, `draw_sprite`, `print_number`
   - These need stdlib implementation

2. **Advanced Features** (8 files)
   - Lambda expressions
   - Interface methods
   - Error handling with `?`
   - Generic types

3. **Metafunctions** (6 files)
   - `@ptr` not implemented
   - Complex `@minz` usage
   - MIR blocks

4. **Struct Field Access** (5 files)
   - Impl blocks with missing field definitions
   - Self parameter in methods

## Next Steps

### Quick Wins (Would add ~10% success rate)
1. Implement missing print functions
2. Fix struct field access in impl blocks
3. Add `@ptr` metafunction

### Medium Effort (Would add ~15% success rate)
1. Complete lambda expression support
2. Fix interface method dispatch
3. Implement error propagation

### Major Features (Would add ~10% success rate)
1. Generic type support
2. MIR function blocks
3. Advanced metaprogramming

## Conclusion

The fixes today improved specific parsing issues but the overall success rate is limited by missing language features and stdlib functions. The compiler is more correct but needs feature completion to reach higher success rates.

The 64% success rate represents solid core functionality with room for growth through feature implementation rather than bug fixes.
