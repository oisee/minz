## 📊 Detailed Test Results

### Supertest Z80 Analysis

Our comprehensive 700+ line test covering all Z80 instruction categories revealed:

#### MZA Issues (Critical Gaps)
1. **Invalid LD operations** - Lines 73-82: Memory addressing modes missing
2. **Register encoding errors** - Line 95: Invalid 8-bit register encoding
3. **Jump instruction gaps** - Lines 246-247: Advanced jump modes unsupported  
4. **Relative jump range** - Multiple out-of-range errors
5. **IX/IY limitations** - Line 293: Push/Pop register support incomplete

#### SjASMPlus Issues (Strict Limitations)
1. **Duplicate labels** - Lines 282, 680: Rejects valid label redefinition patterns
2. **String escape handling** - Line 670: `\0` escape sequence rejected
3. **IX/IY half registers** - Lines 359-410: Completely rejects undocumented but valid opcodes
4. **Byte alignment** - Line 714: "Bytes lost" error suggests alignment issues

### Corpus Analysis (2,020 Files, 50 Sample Tested)

#### File Categories and Results

| Category | Example Issues | MZA | SjASMPlus |
|----------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| **MinZ Hierarchical Labels** | `..hello_char.main`, `Users.alice.dev.minz-ts...` | ✅ Handles | ❌ Rejects |
| **Self-Modifying Code** | `x$immOP`, `x$imm0` labels | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Invalid syntax |
| **Shadow Registers** | `LD E', A`, `LD D', A` | ❌ Unsupported | ❌ Illegal instruction |
| **MinZ Generated Patterns** | Complex expressions, nested labels | ✅ Better | ❌ Multiple failures |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why MZA Outperforms on MinZ Files
1. **Modern Parser**: Handles complex label hierarchies from MinZ codegen
2. **Flexible Syntax**: Accepts non-standard but valid assembly patterns  
3. **Recent Enhancements**: Local label fixes, multi-arg support, fake instructions

### Why SjASMPlus Struggles  
1. **Strict Validation**: Rejects many MinZ-generated assembly patterns
2. **Legacy Limitations**: Doesn't handle modern hierarchical label schemes
3. **Conservative Approach**: Blocks undocumented but valid Z80 features

### Why Both Fail Overall
1. **Incomplete Instruction Sets**: Both miss significant Z80 instruction coverage
2. **MinZ Assembly Complexity**: Generated assembly uses advanced patterns
3. **Real-world Gap**: Test corpus represents actual compiler output, not textbook examples
